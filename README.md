HEART DISEASE DETECTION:
Data mining has been used for many purposes, especially for prediction system. In healthcare, data mining algorithms are always used in disease diagnosis. Heart disease is known as a primary cause of death over the years. Nowadays, it is one of the world’s most dangerous human heart diseases and has very serious effects the human life. Accurate and timely identification of human heart disease can be very helpful in preventing heart failure in its early stages and will improve the patient’s survival. Many studies have been performed in heart disease diagnosis using data mining methods. In this paper there are some 10 popular machine learning algorithms that can be used in heart disease prediction, for example, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Extra Trees Classifier, Bagging Classifier, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XG Boost were implemented at various evaluation stages to predict heart diseases. In this paper ETC is the best model with an Accuracy is 82% with a precision of 92% and recall of 88%. Then optimized the classification results using one of the hyperparameters optimization techniques random search that shows the best accuracy was 87%.
